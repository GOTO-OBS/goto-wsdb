Dear Dr. Casey,

Thank you for your interest in the AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey 
(APASS) data. You are welcome to download the entire DR9 catalog to use. 
DR10 will not be available until early 2018 at the earliest.

APASS Data Release 9 is an incremental release that only modifies 
observations made from the southern site (declination +20 to -90).  This 
means that only file apass_dr9b.zip is new; apass_dr9a.zip contains the 
DR8 release files from the northern site (+20 to +90 declination).  If 
you have used APASS DR8 before, you only need to work with the dr9b 
archive file.

The data are also available via our Amazon cloud server, at

https://www.aavso.org/sites/default/files/apass/apass_dr9a.zip  (0.6 GB)

https://www.aavso.org/sites/default/files/apass/apass_dr9b.zip  (1.8 GB)


There are some known problems with this data set which you can read 
about here: http://www.aavso.org/apass/#DR9_problems

The files "apass_dr9a.zip" and "apass_dr9b.zip" contain the full data 
set split into zones where "m" are negative Dec, and "p" are positive 
Dec.  The zip files are large, and may take some time to download.  If 
you have any difficulties accessing them, please let me know.

Each file contains a header, followed by one record per star.  The star 
record format is:

A10  field name
F11.6  RA (decimal degrees)
F7.3   RA error (arcsec)
F11.6  DEC (decimal degrees)
F7.3   DEC error (arcsec)
I5     nobs (number of observed nights)
I5     mobs (number of images for this field, usually nobs*5)
F7.3   V
F7.3   (B-V)
F7.3   B
F7.3   g'
F7.3   r'
F7.3   i'
F7.3   Verr
F7.3   (B-V)err
F7.3   Berr
F7.3   g'err
F7.3   r'err
F7.3   i'err

When submitting a journal publication based on APASS data, please check 
with Arne Henden (arne@aavso.org) to see if the first APASS system paper 
has been published and therefore is citable.  If you are submitting to 
AJ/ApJ etc., please include the facilities keyword "AAVSO".  For all 
publications, include the following acknowledgment:

"This paper makes use of data from the AAVSO Photometric All Sky Survey, 
whose funding has been provided by the Robert Martin Ayers Sciences Fund
and by the NSF under grant AST-1412587."

If use of the APASS data is a major part of your publication, such as in 
the generation of an input catalog for some study, then we strongly 
suggest that you include one of the primary APASS researchers as a 
co-author.  Not only has the survey been mostly privately funded, but
also there are several defects in the interim catalog that an APASS 
researcher can help you in understanding and thereby improve your 
paper.  Again, contact Arne Henden first.

We request that all parties downloading the full catalog get permission 
from the AAVSO, so please do not post the catalog URLs or give them to 
anyone else.

Thanks again for your interest in APASS. We hope it serves you well.

Best regards,

Bert Pablo
